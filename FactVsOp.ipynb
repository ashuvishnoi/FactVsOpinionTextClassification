The Daily Mail reports Trevor’s South African mechanic stepdad, Abel Shingange, shot the comedian’s mother Patricia at their home in Johannesburg, South Africa, in 2009 and, believing she was dead, attempted to find a then-25-year-old Noah while armed with a handgun. The Daily Show heir’s grandmother tells the Mail Noah escaped with his life only because he was hard to find. So when Patricia’s husband began to hunt him he couldn’t find him… They are very lucky to be alive, thank you to God, Abel was a horrible, horrible man, I hated him. Trevor’s former stepdad was reportedly often violent and sometimes beat his mother with old bicycle frames and slapped her in public. In 2009, his actions were near fatal after he became jealous that Patricia was engaged to her current husband, a man named Sfiso Khoza, the site reports. “I am lucky to be alive. When God writes he has to write for humans and he gives you a message that God is bigger than death.”\\n\\nShe was rushed to the hospital and credits Noah with footing the bill for her private health care. “I was very grateful.

              " 'Larry Hunter claims he is a “lifelong conservative.” Yet, in his recent New York Daily News article, he also says he is voting for Barack Obama for president. The two simply cannot coexist. One has to be obliterated in favor of the other. And, regardless of the facile reasoning Hunter gives for his apostasy, this article does nothing to support any supposed conservative cause. Larry Hunter begins by assuring us of his conservative credentials. A supply sider from the Reagan White House, Hunter had a 5-year-long stint as chief economist at the U.S. Chamber of Commerce, was a member of Bob Dole’s economic team for the 1996 presidential race and was chief economist for Jack Kemp’s Empower America. All of this does confirm his economic conservatism. Still, regardless, we can take at face value his credentials and mark him as generally on the right side of the issues. It turns out he isn’t voting “for” Barack Obama, he’s voting against the Republican Party. And that is NOT a legitimate reason to mark the ballot for Obama. Hunter’s “reasons” are ill considered, filled with petulance, and self-defeating to the ideology to which he insists he hews. The answer is simple: Unjustified war and unconstitutional abridgment of individual rights vs. ill-conceived tax and economic policies – this is the difference between venial and mortal sins. There is, of course, much room for honest debate on whether the war was justified or not. But that we are fairly in it regardless makes the debate of little interest in the contemporary decision making process. Hunter’s second reason, the “unconstitutional abridgment of individual rights” is simply absurd. There have been no such abridgments. If Hunter means the reputed abridgment of the non existent rights of the terrorists, it is even more absurd. Additionally, when compared to the actions of past presidents in past wars, Bush’s efforts seem wonderfully measured and moderate. But it is his last part that is most absurd, that of the “mortal sins” of bad economic policy. I am no fan of much of Bush’s domestic policies, but to use these failures as an excuse to vote for a party that will institute socialist inspired policies that will make Bush’s policies seem as if it was crafted by Joseph A. Schumpeter or Milton Friedman, well that simply makes no logical sense at all! Admittedly, what conservative isn’t mad at the Bush administration? There really are but a handful of things Bush did well — or at least stood on the right side of the issue over — so no conservative has been happy since he took office. So-called “compassionate conservatism” was merely an excuse for big-goverment, no conservative denies that. Additionally, few conservatives trust McCain to be much better. However, we can at least say that McCain has a lifelong aversion to raising taxes and is a consistent budget hawk. Certainly all a voter can base his vote on is the record, not the rhetoric and campaign promises, and McCain’s economic record places him in the conservative camp. Obama’s, on the other hand, is a socialist’s record. There is nothing whatever conservative or even moderate about Barack Obama’s actual voting record. For an economist mad at the Bush administration’s economic record and calling that record a “venal and mortal sin” because of its lack of conservative principle to then vote for a man who’s record places him on the socialist side of the line is just plain foolish. But, what we can easily see is that Larry Hunter seems to hail from the abjectly isolationist, paleo-conservative branch of conservatism because the war appears to be his overriding concern. But how we extract ourselves from the bloody boondoggle in Iraq, how we avoid getting into a war with Iran and how we preserve our individual rights while dealing with real foreign threats – these are of greater importance. This claim of Iraq being a “bloody boondoggle” is simple-minded rhetoric at best, an outright lie at worst. But to Iran his assumption is, of course, that we must avoid a war with Iran. In fact, his base assumption that war with Iran must be avoided places him in the immoral, Chamberlainesque, peace-in-our-times camp and that camp is not “conservative” but merely blind. And even as he reiterates his nonsensical feeling that all our “individual rights” have been violated by Bush, he hasn’t a case to make there but one based on wild-eyed alarmism. First he says where he imagines the candidates stand on the war based on what he’s heard them say. John McCain would continue the Bush administration’s commitment to interventionism and constitutional overreach. Hunter bases his feeling on Obama’s suitably “conservative” ideas on foreign policy on the man’s rhetoric on the campaign trail and uses that as an excuse to bash McCain. OK, well and good. But, then Hunter immediately follows that with the next paragraph. Plus, when it comes to domestic issues, I don’t take Obama at his word. That may sound cynical. But the fact that he says just about all the wrong things on domestic issues doesn’t bother me as much as it once would have. It is a sad commentary on American politics today, but it’s taken as a given that politicians, all of them, must pander, obfuscate and prevaricate. This is stunningly facile reasoning. On one hand he fully believes Obama’s unsupportable campaign rhetoric on what his foreign policy will be — unsupportable because he has no track record by which to prove his claims, quite unlike McCain — but then goes on to say he doesn’t believe what Obama says about domestic policy and can, therefore, completely blow off Obama’s rhetoric! Talk about cognitive dissonance. How can a candidate’s word be taken for gospel on one issue but not on any others? Either Obama’s rhetoric can be believed or it cannot, especially in light of his actual voting record. Then Hunter foolishly launches into off handed praise for Obama’s “centrist advisers” and uses that as an excuse to support his candidacy. But the record is the record and Obama has not ever had a record of voting for any “centrist” positions. But, for all his carping about Bush and the Republican’s economic failures, despite his entire life’s service as a conservative economist, Hunter gives us a contradictory line about Obama. But here’s the thing: Even if my hopes on domestic policy are dashed and Obama reveals himself as an unreconstructed, dyed-in-the-wool, big-government liberal, I’m still voting for him. Consequently, we see that Hunter’s overarching problem is the foreign policy issue. He feels that Bush has illegitimately “spent over a trillion dollars on foreign soil – and lost countless lives – and done what I consider irreparable damage to our Constitution.” He thinks that McCain will merely continue Bush’s bad policies and this is enough to make him vote Obama. If economic damage from well-intentioned but misbegotten Obama economic schemes is the ransom we must pay him to clean up this foreign policy mess, then so be it. It’s not nearly as costly as enduring four more years of what we suffered the last eight years. In this I have to say that Larry Hunter has no clue what the word “suffered” means. Our economy has not “suffered” too badly from the expenditures in Iraq and Afghanistan. Obviously, the war has touched only a small portion of our people and few Americans have been much put out by it. Even the battle deaths are miniscule compared to any of our past wars. (And YES, speaking as a father of one of our soldiers, it is heartrending to lose even one soldier)\\n\\nLarry Hunter reveals himself to be Chicken Little where it concerns our current level of “suffering” and a complete traitor to all other conservative causes on nearly every level in his hyperventilating over the matter. One can legitimately refuse to vote for John McCain, but to actually and purposefully vote for Barack Obama is a direct stab in the heart to supposed conservative principles. One can only presume that Larry Hunter does not really find a principle an insoluble idea but considers it, rather, something that can be dispensed with on a whim. And to be sure, being anti-War is not a “conservative” principle. It is, in fact, its very own principle, a pacifist’s. Pacifism is not a conservative principle but a utopian’s. It is a foolhardy idea based on a failed assumption about the innate goodness of human kind and it is a decidedly unAmerican ideal. Even as far back as George Washington, a truly American principle is to constantly be ready for war — that being the only true guarantee of peace. And being ready for war also means to be willing to engage in it. Larry Hunter believes that getting out of war, in any manner at all, should be the nation’s only priority. And he believes with a faith of religious proportions that Barack Obama will fulfill that wish. Larry Hunter’s only problem is that the train he hopes Obama will catch has long since left the station and that any moves to precipitously withdraw from the Mid East now would do far more damage to the world in general and the United States in particular and will pale in comparison to the economic damage the Obama will do to this nation. All following Hunter’s prescription will do is give us a bad economy and even worse foreign policy than we currently have. If Larry Hunter imagines the GOP has strayed, voting for its mirror opposite does nothing to help right the only party that would even come close to his proclaimed principles. The axiom of cutting off one’s nose despite one’s face applies here in spades. He has damaged the Republican brand further, damaged the economy should enough people follow his recommendation, and endangered us all on the war on terror. He has also foolishly handed the MSM ammunition that they will turn on every single principle, but one, that he seems to claim to hold dear. And even that one is a dangerous one to pursue for this nation. Sadly, in every area, Larry Hunter the “lifelong conservative” is dangerously wrong.

              " 'This article is the second part of a two-part series. The first can be found here. First, you change his stable. U.S. officials advise every other country in the world to put human trafficking where it belongs: Department of Justice. Criminal behavior belongs where it can be investigated, prosecuted and adjudicated. President Trump should move the Trafficking in Persons office out of the State Department into the agency that has the stable of investigators and prosecutors to get the rapists, kidnappers, terrorists, and human traffickers off the streets, and out of the business of profiting from human misery. Once law enforcement looks at the RFP, the creation of a global fund, and a huge slush fund, they will no doubt see the project for what it is: a program that will become bloated and impossible to cut because of the great PR value. Replace it with one whose goal, to stop slavery and protect children, is stated clearly in measurable terms and deadlines, but first the problem of human trafficking must be clearly defined. Third, establish a human trafficking conference in Washington with people who are actively engaged in programs that are succeeding in their objectives in various aspects of human trafficking: corporate policies and practices, law enforcement, legislation, intervention in migrant camps, foster care, and restoration and recovery, and preventive measures. Which areas are the most productive to focus time, money and effort on to achieve the greatest impact? These are the important questions the administration needs to be getting answers to before any RFP is issued. Then, the administration needs to appoint a person whose leadership, integrity and management expertise are beyond reproach and hold that person responsible for annual reports on the work that has been done and plans for remediation of programs that do not work. For the last 17 years we in the arena have had to educate those ignorant that slavery exists in the 21st Century. Now, we need to stop the politics, take the moral high ground at whatever costs and get true moral and bold leadership that holds no prisoners when it comes to ending slavery in the 21st Century on the street and over the internet, and reduce the numbers. Human trafficking cannot be eradicated or dramatically reduced unless this administration takes on Silicon Valley. This administration has an historical opportunity to lead on this issue and not bend to the swamp politics in which this issue has been embedded since Bill Clinton signed the federal law against human trafficking in October 2000. Foreign governments know the information used in the annual Trafficking Report at State Department has been wrong for years. The NGOs won’t take on Silicon Valley because they financially benefit from them. That is how Silicon Valley corporations cover themselves. It is all part of the swamp – off the backs of children and the most vulnerable in society. To date – we have never even had a full throttle national inquiry on the institutional abuse of children as the UK and Australia do. We need a Grace Commission like the one on Government Waste in the late 1980s. Shame on America when they say they want to lead on this issue when the incongruences of what we say is not matched by bold action, as compared to our mates – the Brits and Aussies. It is not a complete one-step correction, but it is more than we have internally done in America. This administration must demand that Silicon Valley post the 911 icon REPORT ABUSE button at www.virtualglobaltaskforce.com. This international law enforcement task force was created in 2003 by ninja law enforcement – four men – a Brit named Jim Gamble, who was then CEO of UK’s Child Exploitation Online Protection agency, John Clark at U.S. ICE, Kevin Zuccato at Australian Federal Police and a man at the Royal Canadian Mounted Police. Because Silicon Valley lawyers refused to give foreign law enforcement the data they needed for evidence to take on the maggots raping, grooming, and trafficking children over the internet, and collecting and distributing internet pedo-criminality images worldwide. Silicon Valley lawyers’ stated excuses were – “you have no jurisdiction” to foreign law enforcement. Jim Gamble was the powerful wind in the sail for VGT. The VGT icon has never been marketed fully by any American administration to date; the current administration can be that catalyst. White House staff needs to study it, and then President Trump needs to sign a Presidential Directive to put the VGT icon linking to their REPORT ABUSE button on every USG site to make it known to children and parents, and demand that the Silicon Valley put it all over their sites if they want to do business with families. Social media sites have access to children that establishes an ethical and, one can argue, a legal responsibility to ensure their safety. Clearly, that is only one step; the obvious one is to monitor the material that is posted, which Silicon Valley does not do effectively. Recently, the BBC challenged Zuckerberg directly about internet pedo-criminality images. How ironic that is. In 2010, Jim Gamble challenged Zuckerberg to post the VGT icon all over Facebook, and Facebook refused, citing that it was “expensive real estate.”\\n\\nSilicon Valley has a huge corporate responsibility for the expansion of smut that this administration needs to address in a diligent way. In the 1990s, AOL knew internet child porn was a problem, and it is an even greater problem today. It is yet another reason human trafficking must be in the Department of Justice. If the crimes are illegal on the street, they are illegal over the internet. Law enforcement must investigate diligently and determine how best to solve the problem of using the Internet and social media for expanding human trafficking. Every law enforcement official in the world knows that traffickers and pedophiles use porn to groom children. People need to get serious about child rape and slavery in the 21st Century because peoples’ lives are shattered. Senator Grassley signed a letter in 2012 and cited congressional testimony that 83% of the victims in these horrific images were 6 – 12 years of age; 19% of them were of babies and infants three years of age or younger. Today, both Verizon and Comcast offer incest-themed porn. And, when you cross-reference which politicians accept their political donations, it makes one wonder if there is a moral compass on Capitol Hill. When infants and very young children are raped on live streams over the internet as these cybercrime law enforcement officials know, eyes should be popping with disgust and horror in halls of power. When law enforcement finds maggots trolling over the internet wanting to buy babies to boil, and cannibalize, as these law enforcement know, the public outcry should be at its height. The public needs to wake up, and grasp how serious human trafficking is, and what a sham this is when large NGOs claim they are fighting human trafficking without taking on Silicon Valley in the Digital Age of Slavery. Conferences where NGOs slap each other on the back for passing more ineffective regulations, and pay lip service to this issue do not protect children or end human trafficking. What this endeavor needs is bold leadership akin to Ida Tarp going after Standard Oil, or Teddy Roosevelt going after the railroads. America will love a president who protects their children. The ultimate goal should be to prevent the increase in the population of human trafficked victims by protecting children worldwide, and shut down the operations that fuel this insidious commodification of human beings with vengeance and a Churchillian commitment the likes of which this arena has yet to witness. Christine Dolan is an investigative journalist, and the former CNN Political Director. She is an authority on human trafficking globally having covered it for over 17 years. She is the author of Shattered Innocence – The Millennium Holocaust, and In the Name of God, two authoritative investigations on the global phenomenon of human trafficking, and the global Catholic abuse scandals.',\n",
